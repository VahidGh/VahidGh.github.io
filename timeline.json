I also set up a start-up team for more research.\\n-WormMathBook: Based on some previous experiences on solving engineering math problems using Python, which you can find a sample solution manual book I've written over here: https://gitlab.com/vahidgh/engineering-math/-/tree/master. I decided to start working on a similar book for educational purposes for the OpenWorm project as well. This project has a great potential to summarize the essence of what we are doing and going to do at the OpenWorm and be a good platform for some teamwork on this regard: https://github.com/openworm/worm-math-book.\\n-PyANNOW: a Python-based project for simulating some Artificial Neural Networks with a simplified point of view (the way the worm looks into it).\\n-Projects: Chopen, ChModeler, PredyChannel:\\nThe aim of these projects are to collect a dataset of ion channel information, investigate modeling approaches and predict ion channel kinetics.\\n-Invented a new super model for ion channels that solves the problem with different equations and parameter sets we usually deal with when trying to use or fit to HH-style or Markov models.\\n-Developed a fitter in Python that fits data to this model with the least number of parameters (only 10 parameters for almost all ion channel types) within seconds with a really efficient resource-consuming approach.\\n-Developed a predictor which can predict ion channel kinetics from their amino acid sequences which can help the prediction of Channelopathies, reengineering APs, etc..\\n-Collected a dataset of ~200 ion channels expressed in Xenopus Oocytes, related amino acid sequences, digitized their patch-clamp data to fit models and applied to a Machine Learning algorithm for predicting ion channel kinetics.\\n-You can find some part of these works over here: https://github.com/VahidGh/chModeler, https://github.com/VahidGh/chopen and some temporary web-based implementations over here: https://chopen.herokuapp.com.",
