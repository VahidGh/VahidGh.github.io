While studying B.Sc. in **Computer**, and doing **programming** as a part-time job, the enjoyment of **problem solving**, drove me to the field of computer hacking. Reading some scientific books changed my path and caused me to think about hacking into life's code instead of someone else's. While working in the IT industry and later **data science** world, I began to read biology references and applied for an M.Sc. in **Biology-Biochemistry**. Being introduced to the OpenWorm community and some other initiatives in the Neuroscience field, lead me to believe that the integration of **Computational Biology and Neuroscience** is one of the most interesting research areas. But how far we are able to reengineer complex biophysical systems was the next topic I became interested in. I applied for another master program in **Mechatronics** to be able to better understand both the physical and engineering aspects of the most complex machine on Earth -- the human body and brain.
